# Algorithm Problems
This repository contains solutions to C++ practices, as well as solutions to challenges from various coding websites including leetcode, hackerrank, firecode, gameinstitute, etc. 
Please feel free to take a look. 

I am currently experimenting with [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest). 
It seems that Google Test has a lot of functionalities that can be made used of, besides just unit testing. Hence I will have more updates soon with tests I find interesting. 

To run Google Test, set UnitTestAlgorithm as main project. For other general purposes (i.e. debugging), set Algorithms as main project.
